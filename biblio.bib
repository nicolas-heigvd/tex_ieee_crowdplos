	abstract = {Modern universities seek policies to sustain the streets on their campuses by making campus streets pedestrian-friendly. To maintain inclusive streets, campus designers and planners should consider all users. Currently, there are efforts to evaluate street conditions for pedestrians. However, a limited range of pedestrian facilities and abilities make the results of previous studies insufficient to evaluate and promote inclusive walking facilities. This study attempts to create a foundation for evaluating and improving campus streets for pedestrians. This research presents pedestrian design indicators based on different guidelines that consider various pedestrian needs. This paper also introduces the pedestrian level of service (PLOS) for campuses, which is a measure to evaluate campus street facilities and infrastructure for pedestrians. An analytical point system comparing existing pedestrian facilities to a standard is proposed to estimate this PLOS. Although this method can be utilized on campuses around the world, this research uses it to assess streets on the campus of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). This method can identify existing street problems for pedestrians and can be used to propose improvements to existing campus streets. Since this study tries to serve all requirements of pedestrians, specifically vulnerable users whether old or disabled, designers have room to implement accessible routes for pedestrians in campus streets.},

Tohme consists of two workflows, a human labeling pipeline and a CV pipeline with human verification, which are scheduled dynamically based on predicted performance. Using 1,086 GSV scenes (street intersections) from four North American cities and data from 403 crowd workers, we show that Tohme performs similarly in detecting curb ramps compared to a manual labeling approach alone (F- measure: 84\% vs. 86\% baseline) but at a 13\% reduction in time cost. Our work contributes the first CV-based curb ramp detection system, a custom machine-learning based workflow controller, a validation of GSV as a viable curb ramp data source, and a detailed examination of why curb ramp detection is a hard problem along with steps forward.},

To address this problem, this paper describes the novel “Crosswatch” system, which uses computer vision to provide information about the location and orientation of crosswalks to a blind or visually impaired pedestrian holding a camera cell phone. A prototype of the system runs on an off-the-shelf Nokia camera phone in real time, which automatically takes a few images per second, uses the cell phone’s built-in computer to analyze each image in a fraction of a second and sounds an audio tone when it detects a crosswalk. Tests with blind subjects demonstrate the feasibility of the system and its ability to provide useful crosswalk alignment information under real-world conditions.},

	abstract = {A method is needed to objectively quantify pedestrians' perception of safety and comfort in the roadside environment. This quantification, or mathematical relationship, would provide a measure of how well roadways accommodate pedestrian travel. Essentially, it would provide a measure of pedestrian level of service (LOS) within a roadway environment. Such a measure of walking conditions would greatly aid in roadway cross-sectional design and would help evaluate and prioritize the needs of existing roadways for sidewalk retrofit construction. Furthermore, the measure can be used to evaluate traffic-calming strategies and streetscape designs for their effectiveness in improving the pedestrian environment. Such a measure would make it possible to merge pedestrian facility programming into the mainstream of transportation planning, design, and construction. To meet the need for such a method, as well as to fulfill a state mandate to establish levels of service standards for all transportation modes, the Florida Department of Transportation sponsored the development of the Pedestrian LOS Model. The model was developed through a stepwise multivariable regression analysis of 1,250 observations from an event that placed 75 people on a roadway walking course in the Pensacola, Florida, metropolitan area. The Pedestrian LOS Model incorporates the statistically significant roadway and traffic variables that describe pedestrians' perception of safety or comfort in the roadway environment between intersections. It is similar in approach to methods used to assess automobile operators' level of service established in the Highway Capacity Manual.},

	abstract = {In order to facilitate the visually impaired person in navigation, we have developed a prototype guidance system. The main assumption of this guidance system is that there are many straight paths in different real world scenarios. These straight paths have parallel edges, which when captured as an image seem to converge to a single point called the vanishing point. Proper feature extraction and mathematical modelling of the captured frame leads to the detection of these parallel edges. The vanishing point is then calculated and a decision system is formed which notifies the blind person about his/her deviation from a straight path. The scope of this system is limited to a straight path and has been tested in different lighting conditions and with different level of occlusion. A laptop mounted on a 2D robotic platform is used to develop and verify the robustness of the algorithm. Finally, a smartphone based real-time application has been implemented for this visual guidance system, in which the decision system returns an audio output to guide the visually impaired person. This application has an average execution rate of 20 frames per second, with each frame being of 320 by 240 pixel size. The system has an accuracy of 84.1\% in a scenario with pedestrians and other objects, while without pedestrians it produces an accuracy of over 90\%.},

	abstract = {People with limited mobility in the U.S. (defined as having difficulty or inability to walk a quarter of a mile without help and without the use of special equipment) face a growing informational gap: while pedestrian routing algorithms are getting faster and more informative, planning a route with a wheeled device in urban centers is very difficult due to lack of integrated pertinent information regarding accessibility along the route. Moreover, reducing access to street-spaces translates to reduced access to other public information and services that are increasingly made available to the public along urban streets. To adequately plan a commute, a traveler with limited or wheeled mobility must know whether her path may be blocked by construction, whether the sidewalk would be too steep or rendered unusable due to poor conditions, whether the street can be crossed or a highway is blocking the way, or whether there is a sidewalk at all. These details populate different datasets in many modern municipalities, but they are not immediately available in a convenient, integrated format to be useful to people with limited mobility. Our project, AccessMap, in its first phase (v.1) overlayed the information that is most relevant to people with limited mobility on a map, enabling self-planning of routes. Here, we describe the next phase of the project: synthesizing commonly available open data (including streets, sidewalks, curb ramps, elevation data, and construction permit information) to generate a graph of paths to enable variable cost-function accessible routing.},

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using untrained crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (turkers) to find, label, and assess sidewalk accessibility problems in Google Street View imagery. We report on two studies: Study 1 examines the feasibility of this labeling task with six dedicated labelers including three wheelchair users; Study 2 investigates the comparative performance of turkers. In all, we collected 13,379 labels and 19,189 verification labels from a total of 402 turkers. We show that turkers are capable of determining the presence of an accessibility problem with 81\% accuracy. With simple quality control methods, this number increases to 93\%. Our work demonstrates a promising new, highly scalable method for acquiring knowledge about sidewalk accessibility.},

Our Part 1 findings highlight how existing mapping tools provide accessibility benefits even though often not explicitly designed for such uses. Findings in Part 2 and 3 help identify and uncover useful features of future ALTs. In particular, we synthesize 10 key features and 6 key data qualities.

	abstract = {Poorly maintained sidewalks and street intersections pose considerable accessibility challenges for people with mobility-impairments [13,14]. According to the most recent U.S. Census (2010), roughly 30.6 million adults have physical disabilities that affect their ambulatory activities [22]. Of these, nearly half report using an assistive aid such as a wheelchair (3.6 million) or a cane, crutches, or walker (11.6 million) [22]. Despite comprehensive civil rights legislation for Americans with Disabilities (e.g., [25,26]), many city streets, sidewalks, and businesses in the U.S. remain inaccessible. The problem is not just that street-level accessibility fundamentally affects where and how people travel in cities, but also that there are few, if any, mechanisms to determine accessible areas of a city a priori. Indeed, in a recent report, the National Council on Disability noted that they could not find comprehensive information on the "degree to which sidewalks are accessible" across the US [15]. This lack of information can have a significant negative impact on the independence and mobility of citizens [13,16] For example, in our own initial formative interviews with wheelchair users, we uncovered a prevailing view about navigating to new areas of a city: "I usually don't go where I don't know [about accessible routes]" (Interviewee 3, congenital polyneuropathy). Our overarching research vision is to transform the way in which street-level accessibility information is collected and used to support new types of assistive map-based tools.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06882},
	abstract = {Ethics in the emerging world of data science are often discussed through cautionary tales about the dire consequences of missteps taken by high profile companies or organizations. We take a different approach by foregrounding the ways that ethics are implicated in the day-to-day work of data science, focusing on instances in which data scientists recognize, grapple with, and conscientiously respond to ethical challenges. This paper presents a case study of ethical dilemmas that arose in a "data science for social good" (DSSG) project focused on improving navigation for people with limited mobility. We describe how this particular DSSG team responded to those dilemmas, and how those responses gave rise to still more dilemmas. While the details of the case discussed here are unique, the ethical dilemmas they illuminate can commonly be found across many DSSG projects. These include: the risk of exacerbating disparities; the thorniness of algorithmic accountability; the evolving opportunities for mischief presented by new technologies; the subjective and value- laden interpretations at the heart of any data-intensive project; the potential for data to amplify or mute particular voices; the possibility of privacy violations; and the folly of technological solutionism. Based on our tracing of the team's responses to these dilemmas, we distill lessons for an ethical data science practice that can be more generally applied across DSSG projects. Specifically, this case experience highlights the importance of: 1) Setting the scene early on for ethical thinking 2) Recognizing ethical decision-making as an emergent phenomenon intertwined with the quotidian work of data science for social good 3) Approaching ethical thinking as a thoughtful and intentional balancing of priorities rather than a binary differentiation between right and wrong.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for low-level multiscale segmentation of images. The algorithm is designed to detect image regions regardless of their shapes, sizes, and levels of interior homogeneity, by doing a multiscale analysis without assuming any prior models of region geometry. As in previous work, a region is modeled as a homogeneous set of connected pixels surrounded by ramp discontinuities. A new transform, called the ramp transform, is described, which is used to detect ramp discontinuities and seeds for all regions in an image. Region seeds are grown towards the ramp discontinuity areas by utilizing a relaxation labeling procedure. Segmentation is achieved by analyzing the output of this procedure at multiple photometric scales. Finally, all detected regions are organized into a tree data structure based on their recursive containment relations. Experiments on real and synthetic images verify the desired properties of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {The Hough transform is a method for detecting curves by exploiting the duality between points on a curve and parameters of that curve. The initial work showed how to detect both analytic curves(1,2) and non-analytic curves,(3) but these methods were restricted to binary edge images. This work was generalized to the detection of some analytic curves in grey level images, specifically lines,(4) circles(5) and parabolas.(6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniously exploited in several applications.(7,8,9) We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping between image space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figure ground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes.},

However, in recent years much progress has been made in these areas. In this review we discuss ideas for the efficient implementation of the HT and present results on the analytic and empirical performance of various methods. We also report the relationship of Hough methods and other transforms and consider applications in which the HT has been used. It seems likely that the HT will be an increasingly used technique and we hope that this survey will provide a useful guide to quickly acquaint researchers with the main literature in this research area.},

We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions.},

Tohme consists of two workflows, a human labeling pipeline and a CV pipeline with human verification, which are scheduled dynamically based on predicted performance. Using 1,086 GSV scenes (street intersections) from four North American cities and data from 403 crowd workers, we show that Tohme performs similarly in detecting curb ramps compared to a manual labeling approach alone (F- measure: 84\% vs. 86\% baseline) but at a 13\% reduction in time cost. Our work contributes the first CV-based curb ramp detection system, a custom machine-learning based workflow controller, a validation of GSV as a viable curb ramp data source, and a detailed examination of why curb ramp detection is a hard problem along with steps forward.},

A prototype of the system runs on an off-the-shelf Nokia camera phone in real time, which automatically takes a few images per second, uses the cell phone’s built-in computer to analyze each image in a fraction of a second and sounds an audio tone when it detects a crosswalk. Tests with blind subjects demonstrate the feasibility of the system and its ability to provide useful crosswalk alignment information under real-world conditions.},

The method is based on training a separate linear SVM classifier for every exemplar in the training set. Each of these Exemplar-SVMs is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. While each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such Exemplar-SVMs offers surprisingly good generalization. Our performance on the PASCAL VOC detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of Felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. But the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. Because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3D model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding.},

In particular, we identify sidewalk segments in street view images using a random forest classifier, utilizing a set of local and global features that include geometric context, presence of lanes, pixel color, and location. Our results illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segments in a large set of street view images.

The main assumption of this guidance system is that there are many straight paths in different real world scenarios. These straight paths have parallel edges, which when captured as an image seem to converge to a single point called the vanishing point. Proper feature extraction and mathematical modelling of the captured frame leads to the detection of these parallel edges. The vanishing point is then calculated and a decision system is formed which notifies the blind person about his/her deviation from a straight path. The scope of this system is limited to a straight path and has been tested in different lighting conditions and with different level of occlusion. A laptop mounted on a 2D robotic platform is used to develop and verify the robustness of the algorithm. Finally, a smartphone based real-time application has been implemented for this visual guidance system, in which the decision system returns an audio output to guide the visually impaired person. This application has an average execution rate of 20 frames per second, with each frame being of 320 by 240 pixel size. The system has an accuracy of 84.1\% in a scenario with pedestrians and other objects, while without pedestrians it produces an accuracy of over 90\%.},

In this paper, crosswalks and stair-cases are detected by looking for groups of concurrent lines, and edges are then partitioned using intensity variation information. To distinguish them, three methods are developed to estimate the pose: a homography search approach using an a priori model, and finding the normal using the vanishing line computed from equally spaced lines and likewise with two vanishing points. These algorithms, with error analysis carried out, have been applied to real images with promising results, and they are also useful in other shape-from-texture applications.},

To address these challenges, this article presents OSMnx, a new tool to make the collection of data and creation and analysis of street networks simple, consistent, automatable and sound from the perspectives of graph theory, transportation, and urban design. OSMnx contributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building footprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of street network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a simple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in Portland, Oregon.},

	abstract = {People with limited mobility in the U.S. (defined as having difficulty or inability to walk a quarter of a mile without help and without the use of special equipment) face a growing informational gap: while pedestrian routing algorithms are getting faster and more informative, planning a route with a wheeled device in urban centers is very difficult due to lack of integrated pertinent information regarding accessibility along the route. Moreover, reducing access to street-spaces translates to reduced access to other public information and services that are increasingly made available to the public along urban streets. To adequately plan a commute, a traveler with limited or wheeled mobility must know whether her path may be blocked by construction, whether the sidewalk would be too steep or rendered unusable due to poor conditions, whether the street can be crossed or a highway is blocking the way, or whether there is a sidewalk at all. These details populate different datasets in many modern municipalities, but they are not immediately available in a convenient, integrated format to be useful to people with limited mobility. Our project, AccessMap, in its first phase (v.1) overlayed the information that is most relevant to people with limited mobility on a map, enabling self-planning of routes. Here, we describe the next phase of the project: synthesizing commonly available open data (including streets, sidewalks, curb ramps, elevation data, and construction permit information) to generate a graph of paths to enable variable cost-function accessible routing.},

	abstract = {Driven by the recent trends in the GIS domain including Volunteered Geographic Information, geo-crowdsourcing and citizen science, and fostered by the constant technological advances, collection and dissemination of geospatial information by ordinary people has become commonplace. However, applications involving user-generated geospatial content show dramatically diversified patterns in terms of incentive, type and level of participation, purpose of the activity, data/metadata provided and data quality. This study contributes to this heterogeneous context by investigating public participation in GIS within the field of mobile-based applications. Results not only show examples of how to technically build GIS applications enabling user collection and interaction with geospatial data, but they also draw conclusions about the methods and needs of public participation. We describe three projects with different scales and purposes in the context of urban monitoring and planning, and tourism valorisation. In each case, an open source architecture is used, allowing users to exploit their mobile devices to collect georeferenced information. This data is then made publicly available on specific Web viewers. Analysis of user involvement in these projects provides insights related to participation patterns which suggests some generalized conclusions.},

	abstract = {Two parallel phenomena are gaining attention in human–computer interaction research: gamification and crowdsourcing. Because crowdsourcing's success depends on a mass of motivated crowdsourcees, crowdsourcing platforms have increasingly been imbued with motivational design features borrowed from games; a practice often called gamification. While the body of literature and knowledge of the phenomenon have begun to accumulate, we still lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding of conceptual foundations, knowledge of how gamification is used in crowdsourcing, and whether it is effective. We first provide a conceptual framework for gamified crowdsourcing systems in order to understand and conceptualize the key aspects of the phenomenon. The paper's main contributions are derived through a systematic literature review that investigates how gamification has been examined in different types of crowdsourcing in a variety of domains. This meticulous mapping, which focuses on all aspects in our framework, enables us to infer what kinds of gamification efforts are effective in different crowdsourcing approaches as well as to point to a number of research gaps and lay out future research directions for gamified crowdsourcing systems. Overall, the results indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation and the quality of the crowdsourced work; however, differences exist between different types of crowdsourcing: the research conducted in the context of crowdsourcing of homogenous tasks has most commonly used simple gamification implementations, such as points and leaderboards, whereas crowdsourcing implementations that seek diverse and creative contributions employ gamification with a richer set of mechanics.},

	abstract = {As academic and practitioner studies on crowdsourcing have been building up since 2006, the subject itself has progressively gained in importance within the broad field of management. No systematic review on the topic has so far appeared in management journals, however; moreover, the field suffers from ambiguity in the topic's definition, which in turn has led to its largely unstructured evolution. The authors therefore investigate the existing body of knowledge on crowdsourcing systematically through a penetrating review in which the strengths and weakness of this literature stream are presented clearly and then future avenues of research are set out. The review is based on 121 scientific articles published between January 2006 and January 2015. The review recognizes that crowdsourcing is ingrained in two mainstream disciplines within the broader subject matter of innovation and management: (1) open innovation; and (2) co-creation. The review, in addition, also touches on several issues covered in other theoretical streams: (3) information systems management; (4) organizational theory and design; (5) marketing; and (6) strategy. The authors adopt a process perspective, applying the ‘Input–Process–Output’ framework to interpret research on crowdsourcing within the broad lines of: (1) Input (Problem/Task); (2) Process (session management; problem management; knowledge management; technology); and (3) Outcome (solution/completed task; seekers’ benefits; solvers’ benefits). This framework provides a detailed description of how the topic has evolved over time, and suggestions concerning the future direction of research are proposed in the form of research questions that are valuable for both academics and managers.},

This study evaluates the possibility of exploiting FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) tools to build up a PGIS prototype providing Web publication of user field-collected data. Besides increasing
public awareness and collaboration, user-generated content should also enlarge the knowledge of specific phenomena up to the local level. A prototype architecture was designed and tested in relation to a simple, planning-related case study, i.e., the report of road pavement damages. Open Data Kit suite was used to gather georeferenced multimedia data
using mobile device sensors (e.g., the GPS) and to store them into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial extension. Data was then Web-published using GeoServer. Web access was finally enabled from
both traditional desktop-computers and mobile plat forms through ad hoc OpenLayers and Leaflet clientside solutions. The architecture provided support for FOSS applicability within the typical PGIS-related tasks, from field survey to data storage, management and dissemination on the Internet. This bottom-up communication paradigm, which exploits real-time, freely available user contributions, can become a potentially precious tool for making decision-processes more democratic, faster and ultimately better.},
